      <p>Dear Ashley Chamberlain,</p>

      <p>We wrote to you previously in relation to an amount of £450 owed to DWP Debt Management:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Universal Credit Advance - £300</li>
        <li>Tax Credits overpayment - £150</li>
        </ul>

      <p>Please make sure you contact us by <b>25/04/2022</b>.</p>

      <p>If we don't hear from you again we will either: </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>contact your employer, where you have one, to make deductions from your pay</li>
        <li>ask a debt collection agency to collect this money for us</li>
        </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Direct Earnings Attachment</h3>

      <p>The amount we ask your employer to deduct will depend on what you earn and could be up to 20% of your earnings. However, if you have been prosecuted for a benefit fraud offence this could rise to 40%.</p>

      <p>Your employer may also charge you an administration fee; this will not exceed £1 for each payment deducted from your earnings.</p>

      <p>Your sincerely</p>
      
      <p>Operations Manager</p>
