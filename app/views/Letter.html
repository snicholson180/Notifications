      <p>Dear Ashley Chamberlain,</p>

      <p>You owe £450 to DWP Debt Management.</p>
      <p>We understand it may not be possible to pay this in one amount so there are flexible payment options available to you. If you are struggling, you can contact us for help.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you need to do next:</h3>

      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Go to https://repay-manage-benefit-owed.service.gov.uk</li>
        <li>Enter security code xxxxx - it is important to make a note of this as you will need it each time you sign in</li>
        <li>Enter your date of birth</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Alternatively, you can contact us on the number above to discuss your payment options.</p>

      <p>You are in control to manage the money you owe. However, if you don't do anything by <b>15/03/2022</b> we will contact your employer, where you have one, to make deductions from your pay. More details about this can be found in the Direct Earnings Attachment section at the bottom of this letter.</p>

      <p>For help and support on dealing with debt and budgeting, contact:

        </ul>

      <p>Your sincerely</p>
      
      <p>Operations Manager</p>

     <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Direct Earnings Attachment</h3>

     <p>The amount we ask your employer to deduct will depend on what you earn and could be up to 20% of your earnings. However, if you have been prosecuted for a benefit fraud offence this could rise to 40%. Your employer may also charge you an administration fee; this will not exceed £1 for each payment deducted from your earnings.</p>
